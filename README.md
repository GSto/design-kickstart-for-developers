# design-kickstart-for-developers
A list of resources for developers who want to learn more about design and the design process. 

## Books & Courses
* [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org/lessons) It's an email course but I refer it to devs often: https://hackdesign.org/lessons
Basically, it is "design for engineers" and speaks from that angle of explaining the 'why' behind design rules.
It isn't super in-depth, but it's a great primer for anyone who feels like they just don't 'get' design (thanks, @ryanmaynard, for recommending it)
* [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) - Course from the makers of Tailwind about design from a developer's perspective
* [Don't Make Me Think, Revisited](https://sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/) - A book about a "common sense" approach to UI. (thanks, @thetest3r, for recommending it)


## Articles & Websites
* [List of UX Laws - Neurodiversity Design](https://neurodiversity.design/ux-law-definitions/) A list of basic laws. The whole site has a list of principles with links to further reading. Great place to wander and get lost while learning more about design.
* [10 usability heuristics for user interface design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) If you read one post read this one. It provides guidance and rules you can follow to improve the usability of any interface.
